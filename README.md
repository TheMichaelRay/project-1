###Rules
--
Player One is assigned the color black and goes first to start. Players may only drop one chip per turn and must switch each turn until there is a winner or the entire game board is filled. Since the board is standing vertically, you may only place chips on the bottom or directly above another chip. Gravity **will** enforce this rule.
